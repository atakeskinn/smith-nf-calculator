# smith-nf-calculator
A Smith-Normalform calculator written in Python, that also outputs and explains all the steps of the algorithm. The algorithm works fine for matrices with entries less than 10^5. After that, floating point precision errors may cause faulty calculations. I am planning on implementing the algorithm again using BigDecimals
